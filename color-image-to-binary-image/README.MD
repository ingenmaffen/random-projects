# imgToBinary

This Python script can be used to convert RGB images to binary images. (I mostly used it to convert color images of drum notes to printer-friendly version of said images)

## Usage

You can modify the input and output names to match your image file or you can name your image to "x.jpg" and then run

```shell
python imgToBinary.py
```
